                                        Business unit strategy: Effective strategy for business units requires making proprietary decisions about where to play and how to win. The goal is to enable a business to reach its full economic potential.<br>
                                        Corporate strategy: Corporate strategy involves a proprietary set of actions that enables a company to be worth more than just the sum of its parts. The most critical role of the center is to help business units achieve leadership positions.<br>
                                        Founder's Mentality: To win in the long term, most companies need the cost advantages and scale of global incumbents. Yet, in achieving that scale, companies often lose what we call the Founder’s Mentality—the very core strengths and values that helped them succeed.<br>
                                        Digital: We help companies develop digital strategies that deliver on core strategy, delight customers and enable them to operate smarter and faster.<br>
